### Experience

Deliveroo
Delivery Driver
August 2021 - Present (5 months) Perth, Western Australia, Australia
I have dislocated my knee in February 2021 and wasn't able to start my tree planting contract. I've been exercising my knee day by day and when I arrived to Perth, I started to build up my muscles by riding strictly my bicycle for food deliveries around Perth CBD. I love it. It is very flexible job and paid exercise in the same time. My knee is now stronger than ever.
